# Hi, I'm Ushnish Tapaswi ðŸ‘‹

In high school, I had no clue what I wanted to do with my life. The only thing I *did* know?  
I loved design and making things look good. That curiosity led me (by accident) into web development and Iâ€™ve been hooked ever since.  
Now I work as a **Full-Stack Developer**, building digital experiences that balance clean design with solid engineering.

### :) Few things I care about

- Building **robust and scalable** apps.  
- Making sure designs are pretty but also **usable**.  
- Writing CSS from scratch when I feel like suffering.

### Tech Stack

- Whatever the Internet throws at me
