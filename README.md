# Hi, I'm Ushnish Tapaswi ðŸ‘‹

I work as a **Full-Stack Developer**, building digital experiences that balance clean design with solid engineering.

### :) Few things I care about

- Building **clean and scalable** apps and software solutions.  
- Making sure designs are pretty but also **usable**.  
- Writing CSS from scratch when I feel like suffering.

### Tech Stack

- Whatever the Internet throws at me.
