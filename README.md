# Hi, I'm Ushnish Tapaswi ðŸ‘‹

In high school, I had no clue what I wanted to do with my life. The only thing I *did* know?  
I loved design and making things look good. That curiosity led me (by accident) into web development and Iâ€™ve been hooked ever since.  
Now I work as a **full-stack developer**, building digital experiences that balance clean design with solid engineering.

### Tech Stack
- Whatever the Internet throws at me

### :) Few things I care about
- Building **reliable and scalable** apps.  
- Making sure designs arenâ€™t just pretty, but **usable**.  
- Writing CSS from scratch when I feel like suffering.

### ðŸŽ¹ Outside of code
When Iâ€™m not pushing commits, youâ€™ll probably find me:  
- Playing piano  
- Struggling in chess
- Or experimenting with random design ideas
